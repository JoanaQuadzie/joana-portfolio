        I've always loved helping people, whether as a secretary, administrative
        assistant, or nurse. Although I ended up studying Aquaculture and Water
        Resource Management at KNUST, I pursued a customer service and
        administration program with ALISON after university, which led to a role
        as a school administrator. Craving more growth, I challenged myself and
        joined the GROW Web Development program by Generation Ghana here I am
        today pursuing the career I never imagined.
