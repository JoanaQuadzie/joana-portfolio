# MY JOURNEY INTO TECH

Ask me to read an article on _technology_, and I'd rather read a novel full of adventure and romance. Give me a gadget to fidget with or scrutinize, and I'd rather sleep or watch a YouTube tutorial on how to braid cornrows.

That's how little interest I had in _technology_. Nothing about it fascinated me. From junior high school to college, I would sit behind my classmates during practical sessions and let them have all the space, not wanting to even touch a mouse.

All I wanted was to become a **nurse**, **secretary** or an **administrative assistant** as I loved interacting with people and seeing to it that their needs were met. Now you know how sometimes life gives you lemons when you ask for berries. Yes! A story for another day! And even though I couldn't pursue any of these interest in the university, I managed to enroll into a **Customer Service Skills and Administration** course offered by **ALISON** which landed me a job as an Administrator to a school.

Months after of doing what I enjoyed most, I suddenly felt the need to do something a bit outside the box. Something way beyond my scope. Something challenging and brain racking.
