# MY JOURNEY INTO TECH

Ask me to read an article on _technology_, and I'd rather read a novel full of adventure and romance. Give me a gadget to fidget with or scrutinize, and I'd rather sleep or watch a YouTube tutorial on how to braid cornrows.

That's how little interest I had in _technology_. Nothing about it fascinated me. From junior high school to college, I would sit behind my classmates during practical sessions and let them have all the space, not wanting to even touch a mouse.

All I wanted was to become a **nurse**, **secretary** or an **administrative assistant** as I loved interacting with people and seeing to it that their needs were met. Now you know how sometimes life gives you lemons when you ask for berries. Yes! A story for another day! And even though I couldn't pursue any of these interest in the university, I managed to enroll into a **Customer Service Skills and Administration** course offered by **ALISON** which landed me a job as an Administrator to a school.

Months after doing what I enjoy most, I felt the need to do something a bit outside the box. Something way beyond my scope. Something challenging and brain racking. Something that could get me into a team working together on amazing projects and attaining greater heights.

Delibrating on what exactly to do and which path to take, I chanced on the **GROW DIGITAL CUSTOMER SERVICE** program offered by **MEST AFRICA** in partnership with **Generation Ghana** while scrolling through _Instagram_. I decided right away to apply since it was in line with my current role. I was very optimistic during the application only for me to fail right in the first stage. To say I was disappointed is an understatement! How could I have failed when I already had a certificate in **Customer Service Skills and Administration**? Another story for another day...lol

So I had to embrace myself with the numerous quotes about failure and success, succeeding out of failure and how winners never quit. We move. A few weeks after, I chanced again on **Generation Ghana's** advertisement on their **WEB DEVELOPER** program. Now, remember what I said about myself and technology? Very well. You already know what happened then...lol

Twice that same week, I chanced again on the program and asked myself why I kept bumping into it. Then a small still voice whispered, <give this a try>. I pinched myself to snap out of that slumber because there was no way I was giving that a try, so I brushed it off.

I never gave up surfing the internet to find better opportunities till I chanced the third time on the program.This time around I felt like a child of God disobeying her father in heaven. There, I began questioning God. Why have you repeatedly shown me this ad? You know I detest _technology_. How do I take this test? What will I write as answers? How would I even understand the questions asked? And there was that still voice again saying <give this a try> . Seemed this voice wasn't willing to listen to my side of the story so I gave in, <Fine!. I'll try> was all I could say.

I commenced with the application process and attempting to answer the questions was a moment of comedy as all I did was play "vintage games"............find out if you don't know and let's have a good laugh. I managed to finish and submitted my answers and guess what? I qualified onto the next stage! How!? I exclaimed, asking myself over and over and over again. I was in doubt till I completed the second stage of the process and guess what, I passed! Now what initially seemed as comedy suddenly felt like miracles and manifestations of <give it a try!> because I had no idea how I got onto the third stage.

Two months after, was a mail from **Generation Ghana** on my successful application and acceptance into the **WEB DEVELOPER** program. Yes! The _technology_ I detested was what I was going to study. I whispered \thank you\ to that still voice and here I am today, through hardwork, dedication and committment celebrating my successful completion of the program. Ask me how and I'd say <God did!>

With the skills I have acquired, I believe I would be a valuable.....................................finish this sentence
