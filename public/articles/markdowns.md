# LEARNING MARKDOWNS

I've been using Markdowns in my daily messages without realizing it. This tool allows for text formatting, such as bolding, creating larger titles, and italicizing text, much like writing with a magic crayon to make messages visually appealing. I initially thought it was just another fancy way of writing, but I’ve come to learn that it’s actually a powerful, code-free method for formatting static contents in tech.

Say you want to effectively highlight key points, emphasize critical information, and enhance the visual appeal of your text or paragraph, using bold font is a highly effective strategy. But let’s be real. Writing all the code to bold a single word, let alone a whole sentence, can get pretty tedious.

That's where Markdown comes to the rescue. With Markdowns, you don’t have to fuss with complicated code. You just need to add two asterisks before and after the word, phrase, or sentence you want to bold, and you're done. It’s quick, easy, and makes your life so much simpler. Here are a few:

To italize a text: _text_ OR _text_
For a main heading: # Heading 1
For a sub-heading: ## Heading 2
To add a link: [link](http://a.com)
To make image a link: ![image] (http://url/a.png)

Using Markdowns in writing makes text much easier to read and understand, especially for those who have no technical background. It’s a more accessible way for everyone to follow along and grasp the content. Share with me if you have more on markdowns
